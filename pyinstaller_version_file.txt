# HOW TO UPDATE:
#    Change the filevers variable
#    Change the ProductVersion in the StringTable
#    To use this file when running PyInstaller: python.exe -OO -m PyInstaller -w --version-file pyinstaller_version_file.txt --icon=GUI\raw_resources\SubnetCalcIcon.ico Quick_Subnet_Calculator.py
#    (-OO is optional and is for additional bytecode optimization)
